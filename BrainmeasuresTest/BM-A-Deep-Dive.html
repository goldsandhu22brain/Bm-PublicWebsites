                        However, education has unique requirements, so there are a few things to think about before
                        starting to make instructional videos. Now, let's examine ten design principles for video-based
                        training:

                                The student must be the focus of the video rather than the filmmaker's artistic

                            onfor too long might get boring. Consumers want to locate the precise informationthey

                            The actual size of the video (measured in data transmission units) is another
                            crucialconsideration. It may need help loading, freezing, and occasionally buffering if it
                            istoo big, making for a better user experience and even worse information retentionrates.In
                            light of this, make an effort to optimize the video's size and substance (a

                            are regularly changed, new information is constantly emerging, andstudies occasionally
                            demonstrate that a large portion of what we once believed tobe unchangeable has changed
                            drastically.If there are just small revisions, adding to the video module is OK, but if
                            moreinformation becomes outdated, it is preferable to start over from scratch.Using the same

                            and ears. At best, the film is a historicaldocumentary if it discusses the newest

                            using cameras to report news stories? Humans are socially wired tofocus on other people.
                            Having your instructor's face on screen is crucial if youwant to establish a stronger
                            connection with your students. A face on the screenfosters concentration, builds confidence,
                            and shows that the instructor is involved.It's easy to illustrate. Though persuading your
                            teachers to go on camera canoccasionally be challenging, the results are well worth the

                            show them a screen grab of a user interface withtext on it that is too grainy to read, you
                            risk losing their attention.In a similar line, it's crucial to remember that just because
