				<p>Hello,</p>
 
				<p>First of all, I thank you for taking time out to read my message, as I immensely value your time.</p>

				<p>Second, I'm grateful that I had an opportunity to connect with you since you have achieved a lot in your field of work and your input can help me build and grow substantially.</p>
				
				<p><b>I guarantee that, To date, no one has thought of investing in Lean Six Sigma Training. Do you know its market is 40 times bigger than physics wallah.</b></p> 

				<p><b>One of the investors asked me about the potential of this market, and below was my answer.</b></p>

				<p><b>I am confident of this because quality is not a domain anymore restricted to quality Managers and each and every employee needs to understand the quality and application of Lean Six Sigma tools. Lean and Six Sigma are used both in the manufacturing and service sector and not only individuals opt for lean, Six Sigma, and agile, ready to pay INR 1.5 to Lac for 48-hour training apart from this companies and employers are enrolling their workforce for these courses from baseline workers for the basic white and yellow belt to executive level training for green and black belt. The bottom line is the market is huge globally, and if channeled in right away growth potential is exponential.</b></p>
				
				<p><b>I am doing it on a small scale and getting excellent responses, and if we do it on a large scale, then the results will be unbelievable.</b></p>
				
				<p><b>This market is a money-making machine</b></p>

				<p>I, Janam Sandhu, and my partner Gold Sandhu founded <a href="https://www.brainmeasures.com/" target="_blank">Brainmeasures.com</a> and <a href="https://jsixsigma.com/" target="_blank">Jsixsigma.com</a></p>

				<p>I am a Master's Lean Six Sigma black belt and graduated from Harvard Business School. I founded <a href="https://jsixsigma.com/" target="_blank">jsixsigma.com</a> in the year 2022, a dedicated lean, Six Sigma, Kaizen, and Quality Management platform, because I was pretty busy with my training, and Gold suggested launching the website So that everyone could benefit</p> 

				<p><b>Gold is an IIT Bombay Computer Science graduate. He is a highly educated and resourceful person In Nutt Shell he has a solution to every Problem.</b></p>

				<p>To date, <b>I have imparted training to hundreds of companies in the last decade</b> and have posted over <b>100 videos on YouTube</b> this past decade. I have seen no trainer on par with me. Every time I go for live training sessions, I get feedback that they have never had such a learning experience that has enabled workers to practically put their skills to work. In the name of training, I see trainers with poor subject knowledge that is either copied from books or slides. Now I plan to expand and take this platform pan-India and globally.</p>

				<p><b>I have not posted much content on YouTube as I was busy with my work commitments</b>, but now I want to take my platform to a global audience. Before proceeding, I guarantee that this <b>Lean Six Sigma platform has 40 times more potential and value than Physics Wallah</b>, and <b>this market is unexplored and raw with huge potential and 100X ROI</b>. I will make this a global implementation by training trainers across the globe, and I want <a href="https://jsixsigma.com/" target="_blank">Jsixsigma.com</a> branches all over the world.</p>

				<p>Quality, lean, and Six Sigma are the way to go as we enter the age of quick turnovers and mass productions, now Quality is not just the job of the supervisor, but everyone involved in work, whether manufacturing or the service industry, needs to understand Lean, six sigma, kaizen, and agile. I plan to develop a platform that is available globally, and access to quality management studies will become a necessary part of education.</p>

				<p><b>Apart from working on high-end improvement projects, I used YouTube as a platform to impart Lean Six Sigma training. You can view videos on YouTube under my name, and professionals and companies who have taken my training program have always given great feedback.</b></p>
				
				<p>To date, No foreign or Indian company has ever invested in the Six Sigma Platform, though its market is Huge and I am well aware of it.</p>

				<p><b>I am not asking for millions of dollars; I am just asking for Decent funds so that we can take Jsixsigma/Brainmeasures to the next level</b></p>
